Moreover, throughout this homework and all future ones, **please be sure to not re-assign variables throughout the notebook!** For example, if you use `max_temperature` in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on. Otherwise, you will fail tests that you thought you were passing previously!\n\n**Deadline:**\n\nThis assignment is due Thursday, 2/3 at 11:59pm PT. Turn it in by Wednesday, 2/2 at 11:59pm PT for 5 extra credit points. Late work will not be accepted as per the [policies](http://data8.org/sp22/policies.html) page.\n\n**Note: This homework has hidden tests on it. That means even though tests may say 100% passed, it doesn't mean your final grade will be 100%. We will be running more tests for correctness once everyone turns in the homework.**\n\nDirectly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. Refer to the policies page to learn more about how to learn cooperatively.\n\nYou should start early so that you have time to get help if you're stuck. Office hours are held Tuesday through Thursday.
