Turn it in by Wednesday, 2/23 at 11:59pm PT for 5 extra credit points. Late work will not be accepted as per the [policies](http://data8.org/sp22/policies.html) page.\n\n**Note: This homework has hidden tests on it. That means even though tests may say 100% passed, it doesn't mean your final grade will be 100%. We will be running more tests for correctness once everyone turns in the homework.**\n\nDirectly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. Refer to the policies page to learn more about how to learn cooperatively.\n\nYou should start early so that you have time to get help if you're stuck. Office hours are held Tuesday through Friday.

Do it for your own practice, but it will not be incorporated into the final grading!**\n\n\"Unrolling\" a `for` loop means to manually write out all the code that it executes.  The result is code that does the same thing as the loop, but without the structure of the loop.  For example, for the following loop:\n\n    for num in np.arange(3):\n        print(\"The number is\", num)\n\nThe unrolled version would look like this:\n\n    print(\"The number is\", 0)\n    print(\"The number is\", 1)\n    print(\"The number is\", 2)\n\n\nUnrolling a `for` loop is a great way to understand what the loop is doing during each step. In this exercise, you'll practice unrolling a `for` loop.\n\n\nIn the question below, write code that does the same thing as the given code, but with any `for` loops unrolled.  It's a good idea to run both your answer and the original code to verify that they do the same thing.  (Of course, if the code does something random, you'll get a different random outcome than the original code!)",
