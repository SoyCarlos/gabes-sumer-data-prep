Do it for your own practice, but it will not be incorporated into the final grading!**\n\n\"Unrolling\" a `for` loop means to manually write out all the code that it executes.  The result is code that does the same thing as the loop, but without the structure of the loop.  For example, for the following loop:\n\n    for num in np.arange(3):\n        print(\"The number is\", num)\n\nThe unrolled version would look like this:\n\n    print(\"The number is\", 0)\n    print(\"The number is\", 1)\n    print(\"The number is\", 2)\n\n\nUnrolling a `for` loop is a great way to understand what the loop is doing during each step. In this exercise, you'll practice unrolling a `for` loop.\n\n\nIn the question below, write code that does the same thing as the given code, but with any `for` loops unrolled.  It's a good idea to run both your answer and the original code to verify that they do the same thing.  (Of course, if the code does something random, you'll get a different random outcome than the original code!)",
