Whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification, add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! Please list your breakout room number and purpose on your ticket!\n\n**Grading**: Here are the policies for getting full credit:\n\n1. To receive credit for this lab notebook (8% final grade), you must submit it by **Friday March 4th at 5pm**.\n\n2. To receive credit for the lab attendance (2% final grade), you must attend at least 5 out of the 14 labs.\n\n**Submission**: Once you're finished, scroll up to the top of the page, and run every cell in the notebook.  Select \"Save\" in the File menu (please don’t hit Save As), then rerun the last cell of the notebook.  The result will contain a zip file that you can submit to Gradescope. If you are in lab, you can submit a ticket on lab.data8.org to ask a staff member to check you off. ",

Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy.\" \n\nTT was a popular technique used throughout the 20th century that was toted as a great way to bring balance to a person's health. Certain practitioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals.\n\n### Emily Rosa\n\n[Emily Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Rosa) was a 4th grade student who was very familiar with the world of TT, thanks to her parents, who were both medical practitioners and skeptics of TT.\n\nFor her 4th grade science fair project, Emily decided to test whether or not TT practitioners could truly interact with a person's HEF. She later went on to publish her work in TT, becoming the youngest person to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal.",

Due to her parents' occupations in the medical field, she had wide access to people who claimed to be TT practitioners. \n\nEmily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n\nOverall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n\nEmily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether or not the treatment has an effect, *not* whether or not the treatment actually works. \n\nWe will now begin to formulate this experiment in terms of the terminology we learned in this course.

We expect that half of all coin flips will land heads, and half of all coin flips will land tails.\n\nRun the following cell to see the simulation of 10 flips of a fair coin. Let the first item of `coin_proportions` be the proportion of heads and the second item of `coin_proportions` be the proportion of tails.\n\n*Observe what happens when you run this cell multiple times—the proportion of coin flips that land heads and tails appears to change, as you are simulating flipping 10 coins each time!*",
